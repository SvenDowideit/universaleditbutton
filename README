Using this extension, an icon will appear in the address bar (similar to the
RSS auto-discovery button) when you visit a wiki website that allows you to
edit the page.

This works on popular sites like Wikipedia, AboutUs.com, wikiHow and Wikia
and also on most of the major wikis including MediaWiki, DokuWiki, TWiki,
PHPWiki, MoinMoin and many more.

The extension can easily be installed from
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/7804/

If you like to build it yourself, the build.sh script creates the extension
for you.
